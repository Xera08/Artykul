There are many ways to optimize an app's battery consumption rate. Battery optimization is mostly achieved through improving app's resource usage (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc).
So, to keep it simple, all you need to do is lower the amount of operations that device needs to calculate. We can split battery optimization into several fields that we are going to improve:
- [[CPU usage]]
- [[Network activity]]
- Background tasks
- Location updates
- [[GPU usage]]
